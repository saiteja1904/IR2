How does this all play into the Monthly Close for #BTC?

Firstly, it’s worth mentioning that $BTC has been forming consistent Higher Lows for 4-months straight

Secondly, BTC has broken the blue resistance of ~$45K this past August (by comparison BTC couldn’t do this in Feb) https://t.co/eO86oPEcpn",2021-09-23 13:29:29+00:00,,1.0,1.0,22.0,https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1441031971073843201,
rektcapital,"9.

But red is at ~$43700 which is a higher price than ~$42000 above which #BTC needs to register a Monthly Close

Simply consolidating between the Pi Cycle Top MA and red for the next few weeks would be sufficient for $BTC to perform a Monthly Close above ~$42K later this month https://t.co/VYy6zvSX6A",2021-09-23 13:29:28+00:00,,1.0,1.0,18.0,https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1441031965629554689,
rektcapital,"7.

What could support #BTC's price stability above ~$42000 is the orange Pi Cycle Top 111-day Moving Average

Because $BTC is currently in the process of a mid-term retest of the orange Pi Cycle Top 111-day MA

This retest has been successful thus far...

Confirm a breakdown from this support area &amp; #BTC will  drop to the lower half of the Macro Flag (i.e ~$36-$43K)
